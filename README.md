  ## Description

![in case of gaming logo](client/src/assets/images/InCaseOfGaming.png)

Every gamer collects games, wants games, or is interested in games. ICOG is a place for them to create their own customized wishlist and favorites all in one place! 

**Technical stuff:** This is a full stack application using Google Books API. This was built using a MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB Atlas database, Node.js/Epress.js server and incorporates GraphQL API build with an Apollo Server.
